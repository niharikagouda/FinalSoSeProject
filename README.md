Library Management System



Deals with how a library system works. Has two types of users- student and admin. 
Students have roles to issue and return the books.
Admins have roles to add and remove the books.
Implemented using REST and SOAP APIs.
Used thread pool executor to check if a book isn't returned for more than 15 days.
Testing of REST APIs through swagger.
And checked SOAP APIs through SOAPUI.
